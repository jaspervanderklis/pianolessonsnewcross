**Jasper van der Klis** studied piano performance with Sebastián Colombo and Alan Weiss at the Utrecht Conservatoire (BMus, 2015) and with Peter Bithell at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama in London (MPerf, 2017). At Guildhall School he also completed doctoral research on Busoni's interpretative editions of Bach's keyboard works (DMus, 2022; supervisors Professor Sir Barry Ife and Dr Christopher Suckling). His studies in London were supported by the Guildhall School Trust and the Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds.

Jasper was a postdoctoral researcher on the Leverhulme Trust/Research England project [Texting Scarlatti](https://www.gsmd.ac.uk/textingscarlatti) (2023-2025), which charted the spread of Scarlatti's music by establishing the stemma of all *c*3,200 surviving eighteenth-century manuscript and printed copies of his keyboard sonatas. In this capacity, he was mainly involved with data collection and analysis and oversaw the collation efforts of 35 citizen scientists. He co-edited issue 23 of *Sounding Board* (British Harpsichord Society) and is co-authoring a chapter of the forthcoming *Cambridge Companion to Domenico Scarlatti* (Cambridge University Press, 2026) which is dedicated to the findings of the project.

As of September 2025, Jasper is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Digital Musicology at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama. As a [2025-2026 DISKAH Fellow](https://culturedigitalskills.org/), he is exploring the use of national Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) in musicological research using the Texting Scarlatti dataset.

Jasper has performed across Europe as a soloist and with various ensembles. During his studies he had the privilege to participate in masterclasses with many renowned musicians.
