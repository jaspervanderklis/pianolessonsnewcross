## 1. Lesson Format and Location

**Primary Location:** Lessons are conducted at our teaching studio in New Cross, London SE14. Students are expected to attend lessons at this location unless alternative arrangements have been agreed.

**Home Visits:** We offer home visits only in exceptional circumstances, particularly for students with accessibility issues that make travel to our studio impossible. Home visit availability is subject to location within reasonable travel distance and advance arrangement. Additional travel charges may apply.

**Online Lessons:** Online lessons may be offered as an alternative format, subject to technical requirements and mutual agreement.

## 2. Lesson Fees and Payment

Fees are set in accordance with the [Independent Society of Musicians Median 2025 hourly rate for Inner London](https://www.ism.org/advice/music-teachers-fees-survey-results-2024-2025/). Our fees can be found [here](./lessons/#td-block-2).

**Payment Schedule:** Lesson fees are payable in advance as agreed. Payment is due by the lesson or should take place immediately after.

**Missed Lessons:** No refund or credit will be given for lessons missed by the student without 24 hours' notice. In cases of illness or emergency, we may offer a makeup lesson subject to availability.

**Fee Increases:** Lesson fees may be increased annually with one month's written notice.

## 3. Lesson Scheduling and Cancellations

**Regular Schedule:** Lessons are scheduled at regular weekly times during school terms. We follow the standard London school term dates unless otherwise agreed.

**Student Cancellations:** Students must provide at least 24 hours' notice to cancel or reschedule a lesson. Late cancellations may result in the lesson fee being charged.

**Teacher Cancellations:** If we need to cancel a lesson, we will provide as much notice as possible and offer a suitable alternative time or credit towards future lessons.

## 4. Health and Safety

**Illness Policy:** Students should not attend lessons if they are unwell, particularly with contagious conditions.

**Instrument Safety:** Students and parents are responsible for the proper use and care of any instruments or equipment during lessons.

**Home Visit Safety:** For home visits, we require a safe environment with adequate space, lighting, and a suitable instrument. Parents/guardians of students under 18 must be present during home visit lessons.

## 5. Student Expectations and Behaviour

**Practice Requirements:** Regular practice between lessons is essential for progress. Practice expectations will be discussed and may vary by age and level.

**Behaviour Standards:** We expect respectful behaviour during lessons. Persistent disruptive behaviour may result in termination of lessons.

**Parental Involvement:** For students under 16, parent/guardian support and involvement in practice routines is encouraged.

## 6. Data Protection and Privacy
